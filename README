This layer aims to be able to provide basic LSB compatible images.
There are some challenges for OE as LSB isn't always 100% relevant
to its target embedded audiences. 

One challenge is that the LSB spec is no longer being actively
developed [https://github.com/LinuxStandardBase/lsb] and has 
components which are end of life or significantly dated,
expect security vulnerabilities and use at your own risk.

* libpng 1.2 isn't provided; oe-core includes the latest release
  of libpng instead.

* pax (POSIX standard archive) tool is not provided.
